1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  MLS Overview

   TODO: Give an overview over the MLS protocol.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The TLS variant with MLS as handshake is not interoperable with
   vanilla TLS 1.3.  As such, a responder that wants to serve both
   variants needs to listen on individual ports.

   General message flow:

   *  Initiator sends a KeyPackage to the responder

   *  Responder creates MLS group and adds initiator using KeyPackage

   *  Responder responds with Welcome message

   *  Initiator receives Welcome and uses it to join group

   *  Both derive key material from the group which is passed on to the
      record protection layer

   *  Later, recipient and responder can send a commit in-band (i.e.
      protected by the record layer) to achieve PCS

   *  Recipient and responder can still use the TLS key update to
      achieve cheap FS

4.  Interface between MLS and TLS

   The main difference between the MLS handshake and the regular TLS
   handshake is that the MLS handshake introduces a new type of key
   update that provides post-compromise security (PCS) in addition to
   forward secrecy (FS).

   However, since the PCS update affects both the sending as well as the
   receiving stream of each party, the resulting state machine is
   slightly more complex than that of the regular TLS 1.3 handshake.

4.1.  Handshake messages

   struct {
     MLSMessage key_package;
   } ClientHello

   struct {
     MLSMessage welcome;
   } ServerHello

   struct {
     MLSMessage commit;
   } Resumption

   struct {
     MLSMessage update
   } ConnectionUpdate

   struct {
     uint32 epoch;
   } EpochKeyUpdate

4.2.  Initial handshake

   *  Initiator creates KeyPackage

      -  Initiator can use any ciphersuite and extension they want

      -  Initiator advertises its support for extensions in Capabilities

   *  Responder inspects KeyPackage

      -  Check ciphersuite support

      -  Check extension support

      -  Check validity of credential

   *  Responder creates group and uses KeyPackage to add initiator

      -  Group can potentially contain any extensions both participants
         support

   *  Responder sends the resulting Welcome to initiator

      -  Welcome can include potential extensions as long as both
         participants support them

   *  Initiator receives Welcome

      -  Check credential of responder

      -  Check any extensions

4.3.  Keying the record protection layer

   After applying a commit, initiator and responder export a key from
   the MLS key schedule, which then acts as Master Secret in the context
   of the TLS 1.3 key schedule.  In some cases, initiator or responder
   may update the sending and receiving stream keys individually.  In
   that case, both keys are derived and the one not applied is stored
   for later use.

4.4.  Connection updates

   After the initial handshake is completed (or a session was resumed),
   both the initiator and the responder can issue PCS updates.  A PCS
   update is simply an MLS commit.  Since each PCS update yields new
   keys for the sending and the receiving stream, the state machine is
   slightly more complex than that of TLS's regular key update.

4.4.1.  Initiator behaviour

   The initiator is in one of the following states:

   1) Default 2) Waiting for confirmation of own update 3) Waiting for
   the server to update its own key material

   After the initial handshake, the initiator is in state 1.

   In state 1, the initiator can create and send a ConnectionUpdate,
   upon which it updates its sending stream keys, stores the
   ConnetionUpdate locally and transitions to state 2.

   In state 2, the initiator expects an EpochKeyUpdate message with the
   epoch the initiator is currently in as confirmation that the
   responder has received the ConnectionUpdate.  If it receives that
   message, deletes the stored ConnectionUpdate, updates its receiving
   stream keys and transitions to state 1.  If it receives any other
   handshake message, it drops that message.  This is to account for
   concurrently sent ConnectionUpdates, in which case the initiator's
   update has priority.

   In state 1, the initiator can also receive a ConnectionUpdate from
   the responder.  If that is the case, it sends an EpochKeyUpdate with
   the new epoch, updates its sending stream and transitions to state 3.

   In state 3, the initiator waits for an EpochKeyUpdate from the
   responder with the current epoch.  If it receives that message, it
   updates its receiving stream keys and transitions to state 1.

4.4.2.  Responder behaviour

   The responder is in one of the following states:

   1) Default 2) Waiting for confirmation of own update

   In state 1, the responder can create and send a ConnectionUpdate, but
   it doesn't apply the commit yet and transitions to state 2.

   In state 2, the responder waits for either an EpochKeyUpdate with the
   new epoch, or a ConnectionUpdate from the initiator.  If it receives
   the former, it applies the commit and sends an EpochKeyUpdate with
   the new epoch.  It then updates its sending and receiving stream
   keys.  If it receives the latter, it discards the pending commits,
   transitions to state 1 and processes the update as described below.

   In state 1, the responder can also recieve a ConnectionUpdate from
   the initiator.  If that happens, the responder applies the
   initiator's update, sends an EpochKeyUpdate with the new epoch and
   updates its sending and receiving stream keys.

4.5.  Resumption

   The initiator can resume a connection by sending a resumption
   message, which consists of a simple MLS commit.  If the connection
   was previously terminated while the initiator was in state 2, it uses
   the commit from the ConnectionUpdate for the Resumption message.
   After sending a resumption message, the initiator enters state 2.

   If the responder receives a resumption message, it does the following

   *  If the epoch is equal to its local epoch, it sends an
      EpochKeyUpdate with that epoch and discards the commit.  This
      happens in case the connection broke off when the recipient had
      not receives an EpochKeyUpdate in the previous session.

   *  If the epoch is one higher than the current epoch, it it applies
      the commit and sends an EpochKeyUpdate.

   *  If the epoch is two higher than the current epoch, the connection
      must have broken off while the responder was in state 2.  In that
      case, the responder frist applies the pending commit and then the
      commit from the ConnectionUpdate.
